# About this documentation

This documentation is written for people who alreday know how to program and wish to create new programming tasks, **going beyond what can be done using the Menu-driven World Editor included in Reeborg's World.** For example, you might want to use different images, including animation, or to add more capabilities to Reeborg's World.  This is **not** a programming tutorial.

This documentation has been generated utomatically using Jsdoc from **comments** included in javascript source files;
unlike [the existing tutorial](http://reeborg.ca/docs/en),
this documentation is available only in English.

Since comments are **not** executed, it can happen that they do not reflect what the code is actually doing. If you find that the information provided here is incorrect, or if you have any question or suggestion, please do not hesitate to
[submit a bug report](https://github.com/aroberge/reeborg/issues).

Please note that there are many more functions belonging to the `RUR` namespace
than what is documented here.  As a general rule, you should not create additional
functions or other objects belonging to this namespace.
